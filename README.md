## my Home Assistant configuration

Home Assistant installed on Raspberry Pi 3B+ running in Docker with docker-compose.

PiHole is also installed on this RPi.

I'm using Lovelace frontend by default on devices. I cloned https://github.com/ciotlosm/custom-lovelace to my `.homeassistant/www/` directory to enable some custom cards like `monster` and `thermostat`. Read `ui-lovelace.yaml` for more info.
